In this project, I will try to create an app for patients who suffer from neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's or Dementia and their families. This app will have three main functionalities as follows:

- Tracks location of patient and any member of the family or designated caregiver can access the location. 
- Alerts family/caregivers when patient leaves a certain zone. This zone is designated by the patient and his/her family/caregivers and can be modified. 
- sends a push / notification / calls the caregiver in cases where patient is lost or does not remember anything - basically any time of emergency.


Some things I will have to consider:
- how to access maps? 
- UI? Should be as simple as possible for the patient 


Flowchart:
- have a complete design of how the app will work (its functionalities), possible challenges, and then graphic design (make it simple, we are targeting an audience who may not be familiar with technology that much. 

- start setting deadlines and goals

- start!

- ideally want to finish by beginning of August. So approximately 2 weeks.

Location GPS idea for Dementia patient families
- Tracks location
- Alerts family members if patient leaves a certain circle
- Sos button / help me button --> try to incorporate in notification bar 
- Registers family / guardian phone numbers and have call button
- SIMPLE UI is critical and essential since we are dealing with patients with dementia,
most likely those with age who are not adept at technology.

Have basic app layout set. 

5 Screens:
- Open screen
- Home screen (login)
- Main screen (will have note to self and Help button. Includes setting)
- Map screen (map with big icons for homes and special locations. Includes 
		text boxes of locations user knows (gives direction to them) and 
		protective zone outlined on map)
- Memories screen (family pics to help user not forget who they want to remember. Maybe
		include food and location pics, etc. Will decide later)

Starting react-native...
